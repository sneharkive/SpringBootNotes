### What is Authentication? (Indentification Verification)
**Authentication** is the process of verifying **who you are**.

It ensures that the user is **legitimate** before granting access.



### What is Authorization? (Access Control)
**Authorization** determines **what you can do** after authentication.

It ensures **users only access what they are allowed to.**
